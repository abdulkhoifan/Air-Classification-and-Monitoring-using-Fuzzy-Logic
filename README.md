# Air-Classification-and-Monitoring-using-Fuzzy-Logic
The project aims to determine air quality in certain regions using the Fuzzy Logic for its completion. There are several inputs used, namely CO, NO2, temperature, and humidity. The four parameters will be processed with the Fuzzy Sugeno method to generate an output parameter, which is air quality. 

The Fuzzy parameters can be seen in the following data:(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CjDmAYAUfJJA8WZ_C1buFo2899usAQ1_/view?usp=sharing)
